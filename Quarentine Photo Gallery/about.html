        <p> Over quarentine I spent lots of time indoors, finding joy in the little things.
            I found myself crafting and painting alot to pass the time. Additionally, I spent
            copious amounts of time playing Minecraft and gaming as well.  Even though I
            didnt find myself going out much, I tought myself how to do makeup and now I have an arsonal
            of eyeliners and shadows to mess around with.  And most importantly I spent alot of time
            walking my dog and chilling with my pet gecko.
